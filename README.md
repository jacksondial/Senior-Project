# Senior Project

This repository contains the work that I have done regarding my senior project for a BS in Biostatistics from Brigham Young University-Idaho. The project is focused on predicting the number of COVID-19 cases in the Eastern Idaho Public Health District on a future date. ARIMA modeling is predominantly used, as it was determined to be the most traditional and commonly used technique.
